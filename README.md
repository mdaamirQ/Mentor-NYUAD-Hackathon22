# Mentor-NYUAD-Hackathon22
Mentor@NYUAD-Hackathon for Social Good in Arab World 2022 - Theme: Quantum Computing. 

Our team secured #3 place in the hackathon. 

# MediQal (Team22)

Our solution uses quantum annealing to solve Traveling Salesperson Problems to efficiently route mobile healthcare vehicles. We utilize both classical and quantum solvers for this task. Our quantum solutions are obtained by submitting QUBO problems to the DWave quantum annealers via Amazon Braket.

## Problem Description

Mobile medical services (e.g. ambulances, medical supply delivery, lab tests) contribute significantly to greenhouse gases and environmental pollution. For example, it is estimated that an average of 31.3kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced per ambulance [1]. The rapid advancement in medical technologies have led to an increase in life expectancy of more than 6 years between 2000 and 2019 [2] resulting in an increase of ageing societies. Thus, it is expected that more people will require mobile medical services in the future. From an algorithmic point of view, the problem of optimal vehicle routing is NP-hard (it is a similar problem to the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem)[3], which means that most likely it would be impossible to find the optimal routing solution for large fleets of emergency vehicles using classical approaches. There is hope that quantum computing will give an advantage in this area especially for large scale problems (i.e. hundreds of vehicles and thousands of patients). We have concluded that optimising routing of medical vehicles is an important social and environmental challenge where the usage of quantum computing is justified, and decided to focus on this topic during the hackathon.

# Getting Started

Clone this repository: https://github.com/hamza-boudouche/NYUAD-2022

Install all the requirements for quantum algorithm:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Go to NYUAD-2022/team22 folder

`cd NYUAD-2022/team22`

Install nodejs

<a href= "https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJS</a>

Install all the requirements with

`npm install`

Run it on your machine

`npm start`

After starting the website on a localhost server, you can find a website where you can interactively call for a mediQal request. A new node in your location will be created, and the path will be adapted in real time using quantum annealing.


## Explanation of Quantum Algorithm

The code for constructing the problem QUBO and finding a solution via classical or quantum annealing is contained in `vrp_qubo.py`. All that is needed as input is an `edge_list` which is passed into the `wrapper()` function.

As an example, a simple input graph may be represented by the edge list:

```python
edge_list = [(0,1,{'weight':4.7}), (1,2,{'weight':10.9}), ...]
```

Calling this function will 
1. Construct the problem QUBO
2. Find a solution via classical or quantum annealing
3. Return the shortest found path and the cost of traversing that path:

```python
[2,1,5,2,...], 32
```
are the order of coordinates and the total cost of the path, which will be the output of the `wrapper()` function.
